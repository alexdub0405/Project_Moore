                Alan Moore (born 18 November 1953) is an English author known primarily for his work in comic books. He is widely recognised among his
                peers and critics as one of the best comic book writers in the English language. Moore has occasionally used such pseudonyms as Curt Vile,
                Jill de Ray, Brilburn Logue, and Translucia Baboon; also, reprints of some of his work have been credited to The Original Writer when
                Moore requested that his name be removed.
